## Definination

### hypothesis

A hypothesis is a statement conjecturing some possible values of an
unknown population parameter. We can say a statistical hypothesis is an
assertion or statement about the probability or a population parameter
in the statistical sense. The usual way of stating a statistical
hypothesis is to give the value(s) of the underlying parameter(s) of the
distribution. A statistical hypothesis is formulated to be tested for
rejection or non--rejection. The entire enterprise of hypothesis testing
is well organized, mainly through the works of the trio -- Fisher,
Neyman and Pearson A hypothesis statement is usually specified by 𝐻,
followed by the punctuation mark colon (:) and followed by the statement
of the conjectured value. For example, if we want to conjecture that the
value of an unknown population mean 𝜇 is 50, we write: 𝑯: 𝝁 = 50

### Null Hypothesis

A null hypothesis (usually denoted by 𝐻0 is the hypothesis of primary
interest or main hypothesis). This statement is tentatively held to be
true. For example, the hypothesis that an unknown population mean is not
different from 50 will be written as 𝐻0: 𝜇 = 50, while the hypothesis
that 𝐻0: 𝜇1 = 𝜇2 𝑜𝑟 𝜇1 − 𝜇2 = 0.

### Alternative Hypothesis

The alternative hypothesis (denoted by 𝐻1 𝑜𝑟 𝐻𝐴) is a complementary
hypothesis to the null hypothesis which is included to reflect the
direction of another choice of a new null hypothesis should the current
null hypothesis be rejected. It is usually put in one of the following
three possible forms: (a) 𝐻1: 𝜇 \> 50 (b) 𝐻1: 𝜇 \< 50 (c) 𝐻1: 𝜇 ≠ 50

### The Sidedness of a Test

The sidedness of a test is the direction specified by the alternative
hypothesis 𝐻1 indicating the direction of a different choice of a new 𝐻0
should the current one be rejected. When a hypothesis is specified, the
next stage is to test its validity or otherwise. The testing usually
involves data collected from a representative sample. The data is used
to calculate a sample value called the test statistic whose magnitude
leads to an acceptance or a rejection (critical region) of the null
hypothesis.

### Test Statistic (TS)

A Test Statistic (TS) in a test of hypothesis is a function of sample
data whose magnitude determines the acceptance or rejection of the null
hypothesis under test. This is because the test statistic (TS) is a
function of sample data; it means its value will vary from sample to
sample. This means that any test statistic has its sampling
distribution.

### Critical or Rejection Region (RR)

The critical region (or Rejection Region) of a test is a set (RR) on the
real number line specified in such a way that whenever the numerical
value of the test statistic falls into this set (RR), the null
hypothesis 𝐻0 is rejected and accepted if the numerical value of TS
falls outside the rejection region RR.

### Acceptance Region

This is the region in the sample space, which leads to acceptance of 𝐻0.
Of course, the union of the critical and acceptance regions gives the
sample space.

### Errors in Hypothesis Testing

There are two types of errors, namely Type I and Type II errors, which
can be committed in a statistical hypothesis testing exercise. • Type 1
Error: This is the act of rejecting a true hypothesis. The probability
of Type I error is the size of the critical region which is called the
"Level of Significance" of a test and is usually denoted by 𝛼 • Type II
Error: This error is committed when a false hypothesis is accepted. It
would be nice if we can simultaneously minimize both errors, but this is
not possible. What is usually done to get the best test possible is to
fix Type I error at some level like 𝛼 = 5%, 1% etc., and minimize Type
II error.

### p -- value

In statistics, the p-value is the probability of getting test results
that is at least as the results actually observed, assuming that the
null hypothesis is true. A very small p-value means that such an extreme
observed value or outcome is very unlikely under the null hypothesis.

### The Significance Level of a Test

The significance level of a test is the maximum probability of
committing Type I error when the null hypothesis holds. The level of
significance is often specified before a test is conducted. The maximum
probability denoted by 𝛼 and prefixed at a level of not more than 5% (𝑜𝑟
0.05). A level of significance of 5% means that there are five chances
out of 100 that we shall reject 𝐻0, whereas it should have been
accepted. When a researcher has finally settled on the size of Type I
error of the test (that is, the level of significance of the test), we
then specify the boundary of the rejection region (RR).

### Specifying the Rejection Region (RR)

To completely specify the boundary of the rejection region, and the set
defining RR, the knowledge of the previously defined concepts is used: ✓
The form and the distribution of the test statistic ✓ The sidedness of
the test ✓ The value of the significance level 𝛼 of the test which will
always be prefixed or given from the onset of the test

### Essential Steps in Hypothesis Testing

The following are the necessary steps in any hypothesis testing
situation:

1\. Specify 𝐻0 and 𝐻1

2\. Specify the significance level 𝛼 of the test

3\. Decide on the type of test (𝑍 𝑜𝑟 𝑡) and then write down the test
statistic TS and calculate its value assuming 𝐻0 is true

4\. Decide on the distribution of the chosen test statistic and the
sidedness of the test.

5\. Using the significance level 𝛼 of the test, the sidedness of the
test and the distribution of the test statistic decide the boundary or
boundaries of the rejection region as well as the rejection region
itself.

6. The decision rule is then given as: Rule One: We have evidence
against the null hypothesis, meaning we do not accept the null
hypothesis when: ➢ p-value \< level of significance or, ➢ test statistic
(calculated value) \> tabulated value, or ➢ the calculated value of TS
under 𝐻0 falls in RR, then do not accept 𝐻0 Rule Two: We have a weak
evidence against the null hypothesis, meaning we fail to reject the null
hypothesis (that is, we accept 𝐻0), when: ➢ p-value \> level of
significance or, ➢ test statistic (calculated value) \< tabulated value,
or ➢ the calculated value of TS under 𝐻0 falls outside in RR, then
accept 𝐻0 Note: a) Whenever 𝐻0 is rejected, 𝐻1 is accepted. b) All these
steps are common to all test procedures, just that the Test Statistic TS
keeps changing.

### basics

```{r}
table(diamonds$color)
tbl_color_cut <-table(diamonds$color,diamonds$cut)
summary(tbl_color_cut)#test independene
quantile(diamonds$price,c(.05 , .95))
t <-scale(diamonds$price) # normalize data
head(t)

```

### test of proportions

```{r}
## 2.1: Consider a survey asking 100 randomly selected people if they had 
## breakfast on Saturday morning. 
## Suppose 42 people say yes. Does this support the 
## hypothesis that the true proportion is 50%? 

prop.test(x =42 , n =100 , alternative = "two.sided" , conf.level = .95 , correct = TRUE)
# data:  42 out of 100, null probability 0.5
# X-squared = 2.25, df = 1, p-value = 0.1336
# alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5
# 95 percent confidence interval:
#  0.3233236 0.5228954
# sample estimates:
#    p 
# 0.42 
## change values you can using manipulate function to discover more
prop.test(x =50 , n =100 , alternative = "two.sided" , conf.level = .95 , correct = TRUE)
```

```{r}
## 2.2: What if we ask 1000 people and 420 say yes. 
## Does this still support the 
## null hypothesis that p = 0.5? 
prop.test(x =470 , n =1000 , alternative = "two.sided" , conf.level = .95 , correct = TRUE)

```

```{r}
## 3.1: Suppose a flash light manufacturer claims a customer gets 
## 25 hours of light on average on a full charge. 
## A consumer group asks 10 owners of this flashlight to calculate 
## their hours of usage on a full charge and the mean value was 22 
## with a standard deviation of 1.5.
## Is the manufacturer's claim supported? 

## In this case H0: mu = 25 against the one-sided 
## alternative hypothesis that mu < 25. 
## To test using R we simply need to tell R about the type of test. 
## (As well, we need to convince ourselves that the t-test is appropriate 
## for the underlying parent population.) 

## For this example, the built-in R function 
## t.test isn't going to work as the data is already summarized 
## so we are on our own. We need to calculate the test statistic and then 
## find the p-value. 
xbar =22
s =1.5
n = 10
## Compute the t statistic. Note we assume mu = 25 under H0 
t<- (xbar-25)/(s/sqrt(n))

## Calculate the t statistic
pt(t,df=n-1)

## Now use pt to get the distribution function of t 
## To get the p-value
# 6.846828e-05 reject the null hypothesis
```

```{r}
## 3.2: The following is the results of the measurements on each of 
## 6 randomly selected members of a population whose distribution is 
## normal with unknown mean and unknown variance: 11,19,16,21,24,27
## Test the hypothesis mu = 14.0 against the alternative mu > 14.0 
## at 5% level of significance.

result <- c(11,19,16,21,24,27)
t.test(result , mu = 14 ,alternative = "greater")
```

## Task Four: Two sample test for proportions
## In this task, we will learn how perform hypothesis test
## for proportions for two samples 
###########################################################

## 4.1: A survey is taken two times over the course of two weeks. 
## The pollsters wish to see if there is a difference in the results 
## as there has been a new advertising campaign run. 
## Here is the data:

Week1 <- c(45,35)
Week2 <- c(56,47) 
advert <- data.frame(Week1, Week2)
rownames(advert) <- c("Favorable", "Unfavorable")  
advert

## The standard hypothesis test is H0 : P1 = P2 against the alternative
## (two-sided) HA: P1 neq P2.
## The function prop.test is used to being called 
## as prop.test(x,n) where x is the number favorable and n is the total. 
## Here it is no different, but since there are two xs it looks slightly 
## different as follows:
prop.test(c(45,56) ,c(sum(Week1) , sum(Week2)))
```

```{r}
###########################################################
## Task Five: Two sample test for means
## In this task, we will learn how to perform hypothesis test
## for means for two samples with equal and unequal variances
###########################################################

## 5.1: Suppose the recovery time for patients taking a new drug is 
## measured (in days). A placebo group is also used 
## to avoid the placebo effect. The data is as follows:

withdrug <- c(15,12,13,7,9,8)
placebo <- c(15,11,8,12,10,7)

## Plot a boxplot for the two variables
boxplot(withdrug , placebo)

## The boxplot supports the assumptions of equal variances and normality.

## Calculate the variances
var(withdrug)
var(placebo)
## We now test the null hypothesis of equal means against the one-sided 
## alternative that the drug group has a smaller mean. 
t.test(withdrug,placebo,alternative = "less" ,var.equal = TRUE)

## 5.2: Two-sampled t-test with unequal variances
## Let's use the same example as above, but assuming unequal variances
t.test(withdrug,placebo,alternative = "less" )

```

```{r}
###########################################################
## Task Six: Matched Samples
## In this task, we will learn how to test hypothesis for matched samples
###########################################################

## 6.1: In order to promote fairness in grading an entrance examination, each  
## candidate was graded twice by different graders. Based on the grades, 
## can we see if there is a difference between the two graders? 

grader1 <- c(3, 0, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 5) 
grader2 <- c(2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3, 5) 

## Clearly there are differences. Are they described by random fluctuations 
## (mean mu is 0), or is there a bias of one grader over another? 
## (mean mu neq 0)

## We should check the assumption of normality with normal plots
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
qqnorm(grader1)
qqline(grader1,col =2)
qqnorm(grader2)
qqline(grader2,col =2)
## A matched sample test will give us some insight. 
## We apply the t-test as follows: 
t.test(grader1 , grader2 , paired = TRUE ,alternative = "two.sided")
```

notes 1- When p-value \> level of significance or when test statistic
(calculated value) \< tabulated value, we have weak evidence against the
null hypothesis, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis

2-What is the null hypothesis for a one-sample test of proportion? 0.5

3- The p-value depends not just on the ratio, but also n

### goodness of fit test

```{r}
## 2.1: The letter distribution of the 5 most popular letters in the 
## English language is known to be approximately:
## Letter: E,T,N,R,O Frequency: 29, 21, 17, 17, 16.
## That is when either E,T,N,R,O appear, on average 29 times out of 100 
## it is an E and not the other 4. 
letterprop <- c(29, 21, 17, 17, 16)/100


## This information is useful in cryptography 
## to break some basic secret codes. 
## Suppose a text is analyzed and the number 
## of E,T,N,R and Os are counted. The following distribution is found 
## Letter: E,T,N,R,O Frequency:100,110,80,55,14

## tabulated for the cases where the passenger had a seat belt, or did not.

## the two rows independent? The data is as follows:

yesbelt <- c(12813,647,359,42)
nobelt <-c(65963,4000,2642,303)

## and then tabulate as follows:
set.seed(1002)
die_fair <- sample(1:6 ,
                   size =200,
                   replace = TRUE ,
                   p= c(1,1,1,1,1,1)/6)


die_bias <- sample(1:6 ,
                   size =100,
                   replace = TRUE ,
                   p= c(0.5,0.5,1,1,1,2)/6)
## 4.2: Print the resulting frequency table
res_fair <- table(die_fair)
res_bias <- table(die_bias)
## 4.3: Combine the two tables using rbind()
res <-rbind(res_fair ,res_bias)

## 4.4: Do these appear to be from the same distribution? 
## We see that the biased coin has more sixes and 
## far fewer twos than we should expect. 
## So it clearly doesn't look so.

notes :

1- Chi-Square goodness of fit test is a non-parametric test that is used
to find out how the observed value of a given phenomenon is
significantly different from the expected value.

2- The Chi-Square Test of Independence determines whether there is an
association between categorical variables (i.e., whether the variables
are independent or related). It is a nonparametric test. This test is
also known as: Chi-Square Test of Association.

3- **One-way ANOVA** is used for comparing two or more independent
samples of equal or different sample sizes. It extends the Mann--Whitney
U **test**, which is used for comparing only two groups.
The **one**-**way** analysis of variance (**ANOVA**) is a parametric
test

4- When p-value \< level of significance, do not accept the null
hypothesis

5- If the test statistic (calculated value) \> tabulated value, do not
accept Ho.\
6- A very small p-value means that **such an extreme observed outcome
would be very unlikely** under the null hypothesis.

7- Which of these two Chi-square tests utilizes a contingency table to
analyze the data?

Test for independence and test for homogeneity

8- The *Kruskal*-*Wallis* H *test* (sometimes also called the "one-way
ANOVA on ranks") is a rank-based **nonparametric *test*** that can be
used to determine if there are statistically significant differences
between two or more groups of an independent variable on a continuous or
ordinal dependent variable.
